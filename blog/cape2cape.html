~ I ~
</div>

<p>What can I say? It simply had to be done. Chris Thomas and I had talked
about it for years. I even recall a colleague from years gone by, David
Gow, mentioning it as some sort of remote objective when I first got
introduced to sea kayaking (more years ago, now, than I care to count).
But for whatever reason, this simply had to be the year that we paddled
our sea kayaks from cape to cape; Cape Ann Massachusetts (Gloucester) to
Province Town, Cape Cod.</p>
<p>Whenever I chat about it with non-seakayakers they sort of do a double
take, look at me like I'm crazy, and then <em>tell</em> me that I'm crazy. I
never claimed otherwise.</p>
<p>But to any sea kayaker ~~ any <em>real</em> sea kayaker ~~ the idea of
crossing Massachusetts Bay (a 47 mile odyssey over open ocean and
completely out of sight of land) is as natural as a hiker wanting to
summit their favorite mountain, or an athlete wanting to run a marathon.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong ~~ this was no walk in the park. First of all, to
our knowledge, crossing Massachusetts Bay by sea kayak had never been
done before. At least, I know of no written record of the feat. If
anyone reading this can lay claim to having paddled cape to cape before
us please let me know. But that's beside the point anyway. Certainly
many paddlers have logged much more time on a journey and achieved far
greater feats. I even know of at least one intrepid paddler that has
kayaked the entire US eastern sea-board. But, to my knowledge, there is
no record of a continuous crossing from Cape Cod to Cape Ann, one point
of land to the other, a crossing which ended up taking us about 13 and a
half hours to complete.</p>
<p>The planning alone was difficult ~~ never mind the execution. You
can't just pick a day and say, "Let's paddle across Massachusetts Bay
today". So many factors have to fall into place to make that happen. I
think the smartest thing we did was choose a two-week window in early
fall and say we have to be ready to go at any minute within that
time-frame ~~ weather permitting. And that right there is the key
phrase; <em>weather permitting</em>. You don't want to get caught out on the
open ocean, 20-30 miles from the nearest point of land, in a sea kayak,
and have a storm come up. Or even just sustained 20-mile-an-hour winds
for that matter! When you're sitting there at water level and making
headway completely under your own steam, every stroke is critical, and
wind and current can change a pleasant excursion into a tragic nightmare
in short order. Luckily for us, that didn't happen. On Saturday,
October 6th, 2007 The sea Gods smiled upon us. We had fair winds (little
to none), fair temperatures (summer-like), and fair seas (very calm).
And we were off; Chris Thomas, Will Means, Doug Millen and myself ~~
paddling from cape to cape.</p>
<p>In addition to knowing the weather, we had to be able to navigate.
Navigation is critical for a journey like this. When you are completely
out of site of land it is very easy to veer off course. And when your
target is a small point of land 40 miles away you don't want that to
happen. Miss Cape Cod and your next stop is the Bahamas! But thanks to
this miricle of modern navigational science, navigation was a breeze. We
plotted our way points in advance and all we had to do was follow the
little arrow and maintain a straight course. Thank you GPS!</p>

    <p>These images show the course we took. Left: naughtical map. Center: GPS way points. Right: actual course as determined by GPS.</p>
</div>

<p>Originally, we were going to have a chase boat ~~ a power boater was
going to follow us just in case of emergency. That put some of the folks
I was chatting with about this before-hand at ease. But it didn't end
up happening. Our chase boat couldn't follow in the end, so we just set
out ourselves in two two-person sea kayaks ~~ the Tango One and Tango
Two.</p>
<div class="Image">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape003.jpg" />
    <p>The Tango 1 and Tango 2.</p>
</div>

<p>And so it was that at approximately three o'clock in the morning on a
calm Saturday in the early fall we loaded up our boats and set off from
Stage Fort Park at the head of Gloucester Harbor. Set off for Province
Town cape cod.</p>
<div class='heading' >
~ II ~
</div>

<p>The early part of the paddle was eerie. Setting off in the wee hours of
the morning meant, essentially, that we were in the dark. Don't get me
wrong ~~ it was beautiful to look up and see the stars overhead. But
as the lights of the shoreline receded into the nighttime mist behind us
and the rhythm of the small waves lapping at the sides of the boat
settled in, the magnitude of what we were undertaking really started to
hit home.</p>
<p>But we soon got accustomed to the darkness, I turned off my GPS, and set
a course by the stars. What a treat. Getting to experience first-hand
what the ancient mariners must have done, as they set about exploring
their world in the days before electronics were standard issue on almost
any sea going vessel.</p>
<p>It wasn't so dark for long though. Almost immediately after setting out
the lights of a huge offshore rig (Keyspan energy laying a natural gas
pipeline or some such) started to loom in the distance. It seemed to
take us forever to reach that rig, but approaching it was awe-inspiring.
Here were we were, in these tiny kayaks, paddling past this vessel of
gargantuan proportions (I couldn't even count how many stories high
this thing stood off the water). The lights of the rig blazed out of the
night like the lights of a city block ~~ lighting up the sky and
blotting out the stars. As we passed the rig, a party ship shot by
behind us with a more colorful display of lights. And moving at a pretty
good clip! Images of Huckleberry Finn and Jim the slave getting run over
by a Mississippi steamboat came to mind.</p>
<p>But that was about as much big boat traffic that we saw. Even much later
in the journey when we crossed the major shipping lanes into Boston we
didn't see another vessel larger than a fishing boat, despite earlier
concerns.</p>
<p>Not long after we passed that rig and it too receded into the distance
dawn began to break. More than one person since has asked me to describe
what it was like to experience that sunrise.</p>
<div class="Image">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape005.jpg" />
    <p>Dawn breaks on the ocean</p>
  </div>

<p>Well it was beautiful for sure. But what was so much more amazing to me
was being in a such a rhythm with the sea, and paddling on through that
sunrise, and on into the day, and seeing the sun ~~ not just as a
snapshot ~~ but rather watching it climb into the sky and on overhead
over the course of the day. It wasn't just the moment of the sunrise
~~ the in-between time that happens between night and day. It was the
totality and continuity of the paddling experience without the everyday
distractions of corporate life and work that most impressed me.</p>
<p>And on we went. The seconds blended into minutes, the minutes into
hours. The Sun continued it's climb into the heavens and the waves
continued incessantly lapping at our sides.</p>
<div class="Image" style="display:inline-block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:400px">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" width=400px src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape006.jpg" />
    <p>Paddlin'!</p>
</div>

<p>A slide show reflecting the experience would be funny; "Here we are on
the ocean paddling. Here we are paddling some more. And here's another
shot of ocean. And here's some more water". Really, most of the
journey was like this.</p>
<p>By now, we were completely out of sight of land as we were for most of
the crossing. Around mid morning we stopped for our first significant
break.</p>
<div class="Image">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/DSCF8995.jpg" width="400px" />
    <p>Break time.</p>
</div>

<p>Doug got a little worried when Chris decided to go for a swim (it
wasn't exactly 100% intentional) ~~ and a bit more worried when the
radio decided to dive in too (we only had two radios among us all, our
only contact in the event of an emergency). And when we opened our aft
hatch and found the bulkhead full of water, we started to get a bit more
worried still. But, luckily, we had enough stuff in dry bags in the rear
bulkhead to displace some of the water, so with some heavy duty pumping
Doug was able to empty it out.</p>
<p>And so, with one of our radios sitting at a depth of 100 feet, a slow
leak in the aft bulkhead, and morale ever so slightly compromised ~~
we pressed on. No more breaks for a while!</p>
<p>Not long after, with the sun climbing a bit higher into the sky we saw a
fishing boat heading our way. He pulled up alongside us ~~ obviously
intrigued at the prospect of seeing a small group of sea kayakers
paddling along 20 nautical miles out to sea! I had to chuckle inwardly
at his bemused expression when we told him we were in the middle of
paddling our kayaks cape to cape. That would be pretty much our only
contact with another mariner until we reached the waters of Cape Cod.</p>
<div class='heading' >
~ III ~
</div>

<p>Around about half way through our expedition we started to feel the
strain. I felt it in my left wrist, where the repetitive motion and
strain of the paddling started working my tendons. So I had to
continually adjust my stroke to avoid injury. Later I'd feel it in my
lower back as well. The constant rotation and stress of sitting in the
cockpit for 14 hours will inevitably take its toll.</p>
<p>But just as we were starting to feel the strain, physically, it
happened. We were in the midst of crossing the shipping lanes (with not
a ship in sight) when we started chatting about the possibility seeing
whales. We knew we'd be passing over Stellwagen bank for much of the
crossing and we also knew that area is frequented by whales
(Massachusetts has some boats that'll take tourists out to actually see
them in the wild). So we'd been expecting, hoping, maybe that we might
catch a view of them on the trip. Will started joking around, making low
rumbling noises to "call" out to the whales.</p>
<p>Well, there must've been something in the translation ~~ I'm gonna
call him whale whisperer from now on ~~ because not long after he
sounded off we saw them. Chris was, I think, the first to spot them
breaching on the horizon. It was a small group ~~ maybe a family of
three humpbacks feeding. We all got very exited very quick over this. It
was the most amazing experience to be sitting that close to the water
and seeing these magnificent animals approach. We were very happy as we
watched them break the surface. There's one breaching. Look at flukes
as that one sounds. Look, you can see the gaping mouth on that one as it
drinks in its briny soup.</p>

    </object>
</div>

<p>Thar she blows! If you play this movie, you should see 
the flukes of a whale as it dives and the
distinctive signiture of its humpback companions.</p>
<p>Then they started to get closer. And closer. Maybe just a bit too close!
At one point they couldn't have been more than 100 yards away from us!
When we could actually <em>hear</em> them making those same rumbling noises
Will had been making. Truth be told we started to get a bit nervous! I mean,
here's an animal the size of a city bus ~~ bigger even ~~
approaching you as you sit in your narrow little kayak rocking on the
waves. You have to respect that. At one point I said to Doug who was
eagerly trying to get some good shots of the whales; "you might wanna
put the camera away and get ready to brace!".</p>
<p>But 100 yards or so was about as close as they got. Eventually they went
their way and we continued on ours. The experience of paddling with
whales gave us our second wind and on we went. We saw a lot more
wildlife along the way ~~ breaking the surface of water. We saw
schools of tuna ~~ huge fish leaping clean out of the water. At one
point we saw a pod of dolphins porposing along at great speed with some
purpose evident that we would just not fathom. And birds. A couple of
them quite strange ~~ looking like a cross between a pelican and an
albatross.</p>
<p>And, we saw the shark. It was pretty funny really. I just looked over at
Chris and Will at one point and saw a couple of dorsal fins breaking the
surface. Dolphins maybe? No, wait, they're not porposing. Then,
suddenly I realized ~~ it wasn\'t two animals, but rather it was one!
The first fin was the dorsal fin and the second was the tale fin of a
shark! That animal must've exceeded 10 feet in length if it was an
inch! We suspect it might've been a blue shark, but can't rule out the
possibility it was a mako. But all he did was cross our path and move
along his way ~~ in his endless search for his next meal.</p>
<div class='heading' >
~ IV ~
</div>

<p>Not long afterward we reached the fishing grounds off of cape cod. When
we had to paddle through a fleet of fishing boats (anchored just out of
sight of land) we knew we were reaching the end of our journey. The last
8 miles were the most grueling. The sun was high in the sky beating down
on us ~~ raising sweat on my brow and causing the sunscreen to sting
my eyes. The mild tendonitis started to flare up again. And the pace,
which had been a steady 3.5 ~ 3.7 knots for most of the trip began to
slow.</p>
<p>But then, through the late afternoon haze, we saw the faintest shadow of
a coastline and we knew we'd made it. The cape seemed just to pop out
at us, and soon we began to make out details like the small tower in
Province Town a monument visible just over Race Point beach. We were
there. 13 odd hours and 41 nautical miles (47 statute) and we were
there.</p>
<div class="Image" style="display:inline-block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:400px">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape031.jpg" />
    <p>Land Ho'!</p>
</div>

<p>Rounding the point and paddling to the takeout was probably the most
grueling part of the trip. But we'd made it! And that simple fact gave
us the energy to put forth that final burst of speed as we paddled up to
the shore and touched land for the first time in 14 hours. There were
many people on the beach, enjoying a lazy afternoon on the Cape on that
warm fall day. The sun was sinking now ~~ approaching the horizon on
Cape Cod bay.</p>
<div class="Image" style="display:inline-block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:400px">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape037.jpg" />
    <p>Landing at Race Point</p>
  </div>

<p>A couple of guys staggered up to us ~~ it's not every day you see two
21 foot 2 man kayaks pull up onto the beach I guess.</p>
<p>"Where'd you guys pull in from" they asked? "Oh, we just took off
from Cape Ann. Gloucester you know." They were incredulous at first.
"Naw ~~ you're kidding right?" But then they saw the conviction in
our eyes. They sensed the aura you exude when you've just paddled 41
miles across the open sea. And they new we'd done it.</p>
<div class='heading' >
~ Epilogue ~
</div>

<p>My buddy Bill Schoolcraft picked us up down there at Race Point beach
not long after we arrived. The sun was setting by then ~~ simply
beautiful. We were a bit surprised at how great we felt. Sure it was a
long paddle, and it tested our endurance at the end. But we felt
surprisingly good as we packed up our gear and loaded up the van to head
for home.</p>
<div class="Image">
    <img alt="INSERT IMAGE" src="/images/cape_kayakin/CapeToCape053.jpg" />
    <p>Sunset over Cape Cod Bay.</p>
</div>

<p>We were all excited as we headed out from Province Town that evening.
Full of our adventure. The blackness of the morning launch was far
behind us now. The uncertainty we'd felt was gone ~~ replaced by the
accomplishment of having paddled cape to cape.</p>
